abstract: Today, the high number of the rural road accidents has shown that
  accidents at intersections organize high percentage of the total number of
  accidents. Meanwhile, the geographical information system (GIS) is considered
  as an appropriate tool for doing spatial analysis and analysis of accidents at
  intersections. Also, considering that the accident data are massive and
  non-homogenized, the methods of spatial autocorrelation and kernel estimation
  can present connected and more real models than samples of current spots in
  rural road accidents. The purpose of this research is spatial analysis of
  rural road accidents based on rural intersection or utilizing spatial
  autocorrelation methods and estimation of kernel density. In the first stage,
  it considers appropriate criteria for spatial analysis of accidents in the old
  roads of Karaj-Qazvin in the 1388-1392 periods and were weighted by use of
  fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Then, to identify accident prone
  intersections and investigation of their characteristics from autocorrelation
  functions of Getis-Ord Gi*, Anselin Local Moran's I and the kernel density
  estimation was used in order to investigate the spatial autocorrelation, each
  of the useable parameters in five successive years used as a Moran's I
  function. The results have shown that there are 26 accident-prone
  intersections towards Karaj-Qazvin path and 10 accident-prone intersections
  for returning, from the total intersections of two way path. Also, for path
  towards Karaj-Qazvin none of the parameters and for returning path the only
  parameter of accident type contained spatial autocorrelation in the five
  successive years.
