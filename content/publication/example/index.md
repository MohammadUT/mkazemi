abstract: Designing a Geospatial Question Answering (GeoQA) system that takes a
  user’s GIS-related domain question, understands how to gather the required
  data, how to analyse it, and how to present the results in a suitable format
  is arguably among the most important “moonshots” in the GeoAI field. In this
  study, we focus specifically on answering geo-event questions. This work
  begins by presenting a prototype process for generating workflows to answer
  geo-event questions by providing annotations of the domain, comprising a tool
  taxonomy we created from descriptions of geo-operations, a data type ontology
  obtained from the Core Concept Data types (CCD) ontology, and the annotations
  of the mentioned geo-operations with respect to the input/output pairs.
  Finally, the generated workflows are post-processed to restrict the solution
  space and provide more structured solutions. The results of this research
  provide a step towards the implementation of a geo-event QA system capable of
  answering diverse geo-event questions defined by users.
