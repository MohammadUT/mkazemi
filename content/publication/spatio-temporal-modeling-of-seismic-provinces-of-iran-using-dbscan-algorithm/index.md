abstract: One of the most important issues in the field of engineering
  seismology is identification and classification of seismic provinces. Due to
  the importance of this issue in Iran, various studies have been conducted
  using different methods such as expert judgment, computational methods,
  data-driven methods, and smart methods. The purpose of the present research is
  to develop a spatio-temporal seismic model for Iran using robust and objective
  clustering tools. In the present study, one of the most powerful clustering
  methods, DBSCAN, is selected based on its ability to analyze huge amounts of
  data. The DBSCAN algorithm, which acts based on the density of seismic events,
  is capable of detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters. The seismic datasets used
  in this study, which were obtained from the seismic catalog of Iran from 1900
  to 2015, have been divided into three window periods including 2- , 5- , and
  10-year intervals. Afterward, different seismicity patterns for each period
  are obtained by applying DBSCAN algorithm. Then, those exhibited high
  agreements in terms of shapes and locations of clusters with the other models
  are determined. Ultimately, by considering these models and using expert
  judgments, a unified spatio-temporal model is presented. The results reveal
  meaningful information in different parts of Iran especially in Zagros,
  Alborz, and Azerbaijan zones and are generally in good agreement with previous
  studies. Moreover, the results emphasize that a seismic model, which is
  obtained based on considering seismogenic zones in various time periods along
  with the application of density-based clustering tools, will produce reliable
  results.
