abstract: Due to the Rahvar police statistics, 70% of whole crashes have
  occurred at the intersections; thus, identification of accident-prone
  intersections and analysis of the factors in each accident is a vital need for
  the safety of the suburban routes. In this regard, the Geographical
  Information System (GIS) provides useful tools for the spatial analysis of
  crashes at intersections. According to the effects of a wide variety of
  parameters for crashes, applying the SOM algorithm which is able to map
  n-dimensional space into the two dimensions, is very important. In this study,
  in order to analyze accidents in two ways of Karaj-Qazvin old road in the
  period 1388 to 1392, various criteria such as weather condition, human
  factors, type of accident, lighting, type of intersection, and road geometry
  were considered and weighted with an AHP-GRA approach. The SOM function is
  calculated based on considering six parameters with their weights. Finally,
  based on 111 intersections on the Karaj-Qazvin path and 68 intersections on
  the Qazvin-Karaj path, there are 21 accident-prone intersections in the
  Karaj-Qazvin path, and 5 accident-prone intersections on the way back.
  Moreover, Abyek city is the only area that has an accident-prone intersection
  on both of Qazvin-Karaj and Karajâ€“Qazvin path
