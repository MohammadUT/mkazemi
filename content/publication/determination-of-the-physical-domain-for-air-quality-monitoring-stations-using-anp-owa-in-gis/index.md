abstract: Air pollution is a major concern in some megacities of Iran. Specific
  cities in the country have reached an extremely harmful level of air pollution
  which poses a serious risk to the daily lives of Iranians. According to news
  reports, the air quality index of the city of Tehran hovers around 159, which
  is more than three times the World Health Organization's advised maximum. For
  the purpose of air pollution abatement, it is necessary to precisely know the
  air pollution distribution in the area. In order to obtain this figure, it is
  necessary to properly locate the city's air quality monitoring stations that
  measure the spatial pollutant distribution. According to various reports, the
  city must have at least 56 air quality monitoring stations to properly measure
  Tehran's air quality. However, there are currently only 20 stations within the
  city. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to identify the most sufficient
  areas for deploying new air quality monitoring stations. This study provided
  an integration of hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) theories and
  geographical information system (GIS) processes in order to determine suitable
  areas to establish air quality monitoring stations. Unlike traditional models,
  the proposed MCDM method, ANP-OWA, is an efficient decision analysis which
  considers dependencies between criteria and defines different scenarios
  between pessimistic and optimistic conditions for decision makers. This method
  was applied to several parameters such as point, area, and line sources;
  population density; sensitive receptors; distance from current air quality
  stations; prediction error; and spatial distribution of CO, NO2, SO2, and PM10
  pollutants. The output results specified several suitable locations to
  establish air pollution monitoring stations within Tehran Province. The
  stability and reliability of the output results were evaluated with a robust
  sensitivity analysis method. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the
  proposed method can produce stable results. Obtaining knowledge regarding
  population density, distance from current air quality stations, and spatial
  distribution of CO pollutant criteria is essential when selecting locations
  for air quality monitoring stations.
