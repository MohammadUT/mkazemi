abstract: "Seismotectonic provinces are defined as areas that have similar
  seismological characteristics, active tectonic fault system similar to each
  other. Identification of these areas is one of the most important subjects in
  seismic hazard analysis. Clustering methods are known as techniques for
  identifying information associated with the huge number of data. Since these
  methods are appropriate visual representations and provide reliable results,
  they can be an important tool for determining the seismotectonic provinces. In
  this study, three partitioning clustering methods were used including:
  K-means, CALARA, and Fuzzy C-means. For assessing the validity of these
  methods, five clustering validity indexes including: Davies-Bouldin,
  Silhouette, SD, S_Dbw, and Xie-Beni were used. Parameters including the
  earthquake epicenters, magnitude, gravity, magnetism, and fault density, as
  input clustering methods, were considered for modeling seismotectonic regions.
  After determining the optimal number of clusters, in order to evaluate the
  results of clustering model IRCOLD seismotectonic model was applied. The
  results showed that compared with other methods, CLARA have a greater
  compatibility with seismotectonic model in Iran. Finally, after comparing the
  number of optimized clustering methods with seismotectonic model it is
  concluded that the best number of seismotectonic provinces is 13."
