Mohammad is a PhD student at the department of Geospatial Sciences, RMIT University, Australia. His current field of research is focusing on designing a Geo Question Answering (GeoQA) system that takes a user’s GIS-related domain question, understands how to gather the required data, how to analyse it, and how to present the results in a suitable format. Research interests are GeoQA, Geospatial Natural Language Processing, geospatial semantics, workflow synthesis composition.
